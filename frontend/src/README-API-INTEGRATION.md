# Frontend-Backend Integration: Missing Components

This document outlines what's missing for proper integration between the frontend and backend of the Medical App.

## Backend Components Missing

1. **Authentication Endpoints**:
   - The backend lacks dedicated authentication endpoints (/api/v1/auth/login, /api/v1/auth/register, /api/v1/auth/logout)
   - Need to implement these or adjust the frontend to use Supabase auth consistently

2. **Health Readings API**:
   - Missing API endpoints for health readings (/api/v1/health_readings)
   - Need to implement CRUD operations for health readings

3. **Medications API**:
   - Missing API endpoints for medications (/api/v1/medications)
   - Need to implement CRUD operations for medications

4. **Consistent Authentication Middleware**:
   - Backend needs consistent token verification middleware across all endpoints
   - Should extract user_id from JWT/token and enforce data isolation

5. **Documentation**:
   - API documentation is incomplete or missing
   - Need OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints

## Frontend Components Missing

1. **Token Management**:
   - Inconsistent token storage between screens (some use 'auth_token', others use 'authToken')
   - Need centralized token management

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Limited error handling for API failures
   - Need comprehensive error states and fallbacks

3. **Loading States**:
   - Inconsistent loading indicators
   - Should have standardized loading UI components

4. **API Integration**:
   - Many screens still use mock data
   - Need to update all screens to use the API client and services

5. **Type Definitions**:
   - Incomplete TypeScript types for API responses
   - Need to define proper interfaces for all backend data structures

## Integration Fixes Needed

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Set up proper environment variables for API_URL in different environments
   - Configure CORS on backend to accept requests from frontend domains

2. **Authentication Flow**:
   - Decide on authentication strategy: either use Supabase consistently or implement custom auth
   - Update both frontend and backend to align on the chosen auth method

3. **Data Models Alignment**:
   - Ensure data models in frontend match backend schemas
   - Implement proper validation on both ends

4. **API Version Management**:
   - Backend has /api/v1 prefix but no versioning strategy documented
   - Need a plan for API evolution and backward compatibility

5. **Deployment Configuration**:
   - Missing production deployment configuration
   - Need infrastructure setup for connecting frontend and backend in production

## Next Steps

1. Implement missing backend endpoints (auth, health readings, medications)
2. Standardize token management in frontend
3. Update all screens to use the API client instead of mock data
4. Implement comprehensive error handling and loading states
5. Set up proper environment configuration for different deployment scenarios
