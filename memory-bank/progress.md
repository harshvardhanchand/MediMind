## Phase 2: Document Processing Implementation

**In Progress: [Current Date]**

Significant progress has been made in implementing the document processing pipeline:

1.  **OCR Integration using Google Document AI**:
    *   Successfully integrated Google Document AI for performing OCR on uploaded documents (PDFs, images). This provides robust text extraction capabilities.
    *   The `google-cloud-documentai` library (version `3.5.0`) has been added to the backend dependencies.
    *   A utility function (`process_document_with_docai` in `backend/app/utils/ai_processors.py`) has been implemented to interact with the Document AI service.
    *   The function handles processing documents stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

2.  **Testing and Configuration**:
    *   The Document AI integration has been successfully tested by processing a sample document from GCS.
    *   The test script within `ai_processors.py` has been refactored to use environment variables (loaded via a `.env` file) for configuration (Project ID, Processor ID, GCS URI), enhancing security and maintainability.

3.  **LLM Integration for Structured Data Extraction (LLM Call 1 - Structuring & Initial Metadata)**:
    *   Implemented integration with Google Gemini Flash using the `google.generativeai` SDK.
    *   Created a comprehensive medical data extraction system prompt that instructs the LLM to identify and structure medical information, and extract initial metadata (`document_date`, `source_name`, `source_location_city`, `tags`).
    *   Developed the `structure_text_with_gemini` function that processes OCR output and returns structured JSON containing both `medical_events` and `extracted_metadata`.
    *   The JSON format includes detailed medical observations with fields for event types, values, units, dates, and raw text references.
    *   Added error handling and validation to ensure proper JSON format and extraction quality.
    *   Successfully tested the end-to-end OCR → LLM pipeline with sample documents.
    *   ✅ **Enhanced `structure_text_with_gemini` and `run_document_processing_pipeline` to extract and save `document_date`, `source_name`, `source_location_city`, and `tags` to the `Document` model.** (This was largely in place from previous work on metadata fields, verified complete).

Next steps for Phase 2:

1.  ~~Create background processing tasks for document analysis (OCR + LLM extraction):~~
    *   ~~Implement a queue-based system using Google Cloud Tasks.~~
    *   ~~Set up worker functions to process documents asynchronously.~~
    *   ~~Add error handling, retry logic, and monitoring.~~

2.  ~~Implement extraction data storage and retrieval into the `ExtractedData` model:~~
    *   ~~Finalize database functions to store the structured JSON from the LLM.~~
    *   ~~Create APIs for retrieving and searching the extracted information.~~

3.  Develop user interface for document review and correction (Frontend task, dependent on backend data structures).

## Phase 2: ExtractedData Storage Implementation Complete

**Completed: [Previous Date]**

The database and API implementation for storing and retrieving structured medical data has been completed:

1. **ExtractedData Repository Enhancement**:
   * Refined the `ExtractedDataRepository` with comprehensive CRUD operations
   * Implemented methods to update raw text, structured content, and review status
   * Added proper error handling and transaction management
   * Integrated repository with the OCR and LLM processing pipeline

2. **API Endpoints for ExtractedData**:
   * Created endpoint to retrieve extracted data by document ID (`GET /api/v1/extracted_data/{document_id}`)
   * Implemented endpoint to update review status (`PUT /api/v1/extracted_data/{document_id}/status`)
   * Added endpoint to update structured content for manual corrections (`PUT /api/v1/extracted_data/{document_id}/content`)
   * Created a combined endpoint that returns both document info and extraction data (`GET /api/v1/extracted_data/all/{document_id}`)
   * Ensured all endpoints verify document ownership and handle errors appropriately

3. **Pydantic Schema Enhancements**:
   * Added specific schema types for status updates and content corrections
   * Created response models for API consistency
   * Enhanced validation for the structured JSON data

## Phase 2: Background Processing Implementation Complete

   * Added proper status tracking throughout the pipeline
   * Implemented error handling with appropriate status updates

2. **Integration with Document Upload**:
   * Connected the background processing to the document upload endpoint
   * Ensured that document upload responds quickly to the user while processing happens in the background
   * Implemented status tracking via the Document model's processing_status field

3. **Optimizations and Caching**:
   * Added caching logic to avoid unnecessary reprocessing of documents
   * Implemented partial processing recovery if one step fails
   * Created separate database transactions for background tasks to ensure proper isolation

The implementation provides a clean, efficient way to process documents asynchronously without adding complex dependencies. Users can upload documents and receive an immediate response, while the system processes the documents in the background using Google Cloud Document AI and Gemini LLM.

## [Current Date] - API Synchronization and Refactor

**Completed Tasks:**

1.  **API Endpoint and Schema Synchronization:**
    *   Reviewed and synchronized backend API endpoint definitions with frontend service calls for Documents, ExtractedData, Medications, Query, and HealthReadings.
    *   Compared and aligned backend Pydantic schemas with frontend TypeScript types for all major entities.
    *   Corrected discrepancies in field names, data types (especially date/datetime handling), and expected structures.
    *   Specifically updated `HealthReading` types on the frontend to be more specific and match the detailed backend structure (including adding `HealthReadingType` enum).
    *   Created a new frontend type `ExtractionDetailsResponse` for the combined data returned by `/api/extracted_data/all/{document_id}`.

2.  **API Structure Refactor (No `/v1`):**
    *   Removed `/v1` API versioning from URL paths for simplification at the MVP stage.
    *   Consolidated backend API routing: `backend/app/api/router.py` now aggregates endpoint routers, mounted under `/api` in `main.py`.
    *   Updated all frontend API service calls in `frontend/src/api/services.ts` to use the new non-versioned paths.
    *   Adjusted `backend/app/main.py` to use the new main router.
    *   **User Action Required**: Ensured all backend API endpoint files are now located in `backend/app/api/endpoints/` and the old `backend/app/api/v1/` directory has been removed.

3.  **Error Resolution and Missing Components:**
    *   Addressed various import errors and missing component issues:
        *   Created `backend/app/api/endpoints/users.py` with a `/users/me` endpoint.
        *   Updated `backend/app/schemas/user.py` to align `UserRead` with the `/me` endpoint's expected response.
        *   Removed unused `auth` router from `backend/app/api/router.py` as authentication is handled client-side by Supabase.
        *   Fixed minor import issues in `backend/app/api/endpoints/health_readings.py` and `backend/app/models/health_reading.py`.
        *   Corrected attribute access in `backend/app/api/endpoints/extracted_data.py`.

**Outcome:**
*   Improved consistency and synchronization between frontend and backend API contracts.
*   Simplified API URL structure.
*   Resolved several potential runtime errors and missing file/code issues.
*   The API is now better structured for continued development.
