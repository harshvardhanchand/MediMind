The base application is now configured with the core components needed for further development phases. Next, we'll focus on implementing the database setup and connections in Phase 1.

### Notable Changes

- Switched from Firebase to Supabase for authentication, which provides better integration with PostgreSQL
- Updated version to 0.2.0 to reflect this change
- Added specific version pinning for better dependency management and compatibility
- Updated Python version from 3.9 to 3.11 for improved performance and features

### Environment Notes

- When running commands on a system with multiple Python installations, make sure to use `python3` explicitly to target Python 3.11
- All commands in documentation should use `python3` to ensure consistency:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest backend/tests/
  python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```

## Phase 1: Database Implementation & Core Models

**In Progress: [Current Date]**

The initial database models and migrations have been established:

1.  **User Model (`models/user.py`)**: Existing model reviewed and confirmed suitable for linking with Supabase auth (`supabase_id`).
2.  **Document Model (`models/document.py`)**: Created model to represent uploaded documents, including fields for user linkage, storage details, type, status, and basic metadata.
3.  **ExtractedData Model (`models/extracted_data.py`)**: Created model to store structured data parsed from documents, using `JSONB` for flexibility and including review status tracking.
4.  **Relationships**: Defined relationships between `User`, `Document`, and `ExtractedData` models using SQLAlchemy ORM.
5.  **Pydantic Schemas**: Created corresponding schemas (`schemas/document.py`, `schemas/extracted_data.py`) for API data validation and serialization.
6.  **Database Migrations**: Generated and successfully applied Alembic migrations to create the `users`, `documents`, and `extracted_data` tables in the database.
7.  **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled RLS on all relevant tables (`users`, `documents`, `alembic_version`) and created initial policies to secure data access via the auto-generated API, restricting access primarily to the record owner based on `auth.uid()`.

### Next Steps for Phase 1:

- ✅ Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations/repositories for the `Document` model.
- ✅ Define API endpoints for document upload and listing.
- ✅ Configure secure file storage (Google Cloud Storage).
- ✅ Implement the actual document upload logic, including saving the file to storage and creating the `Document` record.

   - Added document listing endpoint for paginated retrieval (`GET /api/v1/documents/`)
   - Created document details endpoint for single document retrieval (`GET /api/v1/documents/{document_id}`)
   - Implemented document deletion endpoint (`DELETE /api/v1/documents/{document_id}`)

3. **Google Cloud Storage Integration**:
   - Set up secure file upload functionality to GCS buckets
   - Implemented file deletion for document removal
   - Added proper error handling and logging for storage operations
   - Created utilities for GCS path management

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Ensured all endpoints properly verify user ownership of documents
   - Added proper error handling and logging
   - Implemented file hash verification to prevent duplicate uploads
   - Enhanced document metadata to track file information

Next phase will focus on implementing the document processing pipeline using OCR and NLP services.

## Phase 2: Document Processing Implementation

**In Progress: [Current Date]**

Significant progress has been made in implementing the document processing pipeline:

1.  **OCR Integration using Google Document AI**:
    *   Successfully integrated Google Document AI for performing OCR on uploaded documents (PDFs, images). This provides robust text extraction capabilities.
    *   The `google-cloud-documentai` library (version `3.5.0`) has been added to the backend dependencies.
    *   A utility function (`process_document_with_docai` in `backend/app/utils/ai_processors.py`) has been implemented to interact with the Document AI service.
    *   The function handles processing documents stored in Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

2.  **Testing and Configuration**:
    *   The Document AI integration has been successfully tested by processing a sample document from GCS.
    *   The test script within `ai_processors.py` has been refactored to use environment variables (loaded via a `.env` file) for configuration (Project ID, Processor ID, GCS URI), enhancing security and maintainability.

3.  **LLM Integration for Structured Data Extraction**:
    *   Implemented integration with Google Gemini Flash using the `google.generativeai` SDK.
    *   Created a comprehensive medical data extraction system prompt that instructs the LLM to identify and structure medical information.
    *   Developed the `structure_text_with_gemini` function that processes OCR output and returns structured JSON.
    *   The JSON format includes detailed medical observations with fields for event types, values, units, dates, and raw text references.
    *   Added error handling and validation to ensure proper JSON format and extraction quality.
    *   Successfully tested the end-to-end OCR → LLM pipeline with sample documents.

Next steps for Phase 2:

1.  ~~Create background processing tasks for document analysis (OCR + LLM extraction):~~
    *   ~~Implement a queue-based system using Google Cloud Tasks.~~
    *   ~~Set up worker functions to process documents asynchronously.~~
    *   ~~Add error handling, retry logic, and monitoring.~~

2.  ~~Implement extraction data storage and retrieval into the `ExtractedData` model:~~
    *   ~~Finalize database functions to store the structured JSON from the LLM.~~
    *   ~~Create APIs for retrieving and searching the extracted information.~~

3.  Develop user interface for document review and correction (Frontend task, dependent on backend data structures).

## Phase 2: ExtractedData Storage Implementation Complete

**Completed: [Previous Date]**

The database and API implementation for storing and retrieving structured medical data has been completed:

1. **ExtractedData Repository Enhancement**:
   * Refined the `ExtractedDataRepository` with comprehensive CRUD operations
   * Implemented methods to update raw text, structured content, and review status
   * Added proper error handling and transaction management
   * Integrated repository with the OCR and LLM processing pipeline

2. **API Endpoints for ExtractedData**:
   * Created endpoint to retrieve extracted data by document ID (`GET /api/v1/extracted_data/{document_id}`)
   * Implemented endpoint to update review status (`PUT /api/v1/extracted_data/{document_id}/status`)
   * Added endpoint to update structured content for manual corrections (`PUT /api/v1/extracted_data/{document_id}/content`)
   * Created a combined endpoint that returns both document info and extraction data (`GET /api/v1/extracted_data/all/{document_id}`)
   * Ensured all endpoints verify document ownership and handle errors appropriately

3. **Pydantic Schema Enhancements**:
   * Added specific schema types for status updates and content corrections
   * Created response models for API consistency
   * Enhanced validation for the structured JSON data

## Phase 2: Background Processing Implementation Complete

**Completed: [Current Date]**

Background processing for document analysis has been implemented using FastAPI's built-in BackgroundTasks:

1. **Document Processing Pipeline**:
   * Implemented a comprehensive background processing function in `document_processing_service.py`
   * Created a processing pipeline that handles both OCR and LLM extraction steps
   * Added proper status tracking throughout the pipeline
   * Implemented error handling with appropriate status updates

2. **Integration with Document Upload**:
   * Connected the background processing to the document upload endpoint
   * Ensured that document upload responds quickly to the user while processing happens in the background
   * Implemented status tracking via the Document model's processing_status field

3. **Optimizations and Caching**:
   * Added caching logic to avoid unnecessary reprocessing of documents
   * Implemented partial processing recovery if one step fails
   * Created separate database transactions for background tasks to ensure proper isolation

The implementation provides a clean, efficient way to process documents asynchronously without adding complex dependencies. Users can upload documents and receive an immediate response, while the system processes the documents in the background using Google Cloud Document AI and Gemini LLM.
