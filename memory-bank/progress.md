# Medical Data Hub Implementation Progress

## Phase 0: Prerequisites & Environment Setup

**Completed: [Current Date]**

The base environment has been set up with the following components:

1. **Project Structure**:
   - Created a root project directory with `backend/` and `frontend/` subdirectories
   - Initialized Git repository with appropriate `.gitignore` file
   - Added `package.json` with basic project information and scripts

2. **Backend Structure**:
   - Set up FastAPI project structure with **Python 3.11** and appropriate directories for API endpoints, core functionality, models, middleware, etc.
   - Configured basic dependencies in `requirements.txt` with specified versions
   - Implemented a health check endpoint for basic API functionality testing
   - Added security middleware for response headers
   - Configured rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Set up structured logging with appropriate error handling

3. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Changed from Firebase to **Supabase** for authentication
   - Implemented token verification middleware
   - Created a protected `/me` endpoint that requires authentication
   - Added tests for the authentication flow

4. **Database Configuration**:
   - Configured SQLAlchemy with appropriate models
   - Set up Alembic for database migrations
   - Created initial User model structure
   - Configured database connection pooling

5. **Security Configuration**:
   - Set up security headers middleware
   - Configured CORS settings
   - Implemented rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

6. **Testing Setup**:
   - Added pytest configuration
   - Created initial unit tests for health check and authentication endpoints

The base application is now configured with the core components needed for further development phases. Next, we'll focus on implementing the database setup and connections in Phase 1.

### Notable Changes

- Switched from Firebase to Supabase for authentication, which provides better integration with PostgreSQL
- Updated version to 0.2.0 to reflect this change
- Added specific version pinning for better dependency management and compatibility
- Updated Python version from 3.9 to 3.11 for improved performance and features

### Environment Notes

- When running commands on a system with multiple Python installations, make sure to use `python3` explicitly to target Python 3.11
- All commands in documentation should use `python3` to ensure consistency:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pytest backend/tests/
  python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
  ```
