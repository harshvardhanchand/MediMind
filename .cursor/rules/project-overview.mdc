# Project Overview and Purpose

This project is an AI-powered mobile application ([prd.md](mdc:prd.md)) designed for patients to manage their medical data, specifically prescriptions and lab results.

**Core Goals:**
*   Secure upload, storage, and AI-powered parsing (OCR/NLP) of medical documents.
*   User review and correction of extracted data.
*   Basic data visualization and listing (e.g., test results over time).
*   Natural language querying of structured data using Gemini 2.5 Flash ([prd.md](mdc:prd.md)).
*   Patient empowerment through data access.

**Critical Constraints:**
*   **No Medical Advice:** The application explicitly avoids providing any medical interpretation, diagnosis, or advice.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to data privacy regulations like HIPAA and India's DPDP Act 2023 is essential ([prd.md](mdc:prd.md)).

Refer to the [Product Requirements Document (prd.md)](mdc:prd.md) for full details.
