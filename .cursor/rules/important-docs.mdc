# Important Documentation Guidelines

## Before Coding
- Always read [memory-bank/architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/architecture.md) before writing any code. This includes understanding the entire database schema.
- Always read [memory-bank/prd.md](mdc:memory-bank/prd.md) before writing any code as it contains product requirements.

## After Feature Completion
- After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update [memory-bank/architecture.md](mdc:memory-bank/architecture.md) to reflect the changes.
- Keep all documentation synchronized with code changes.
